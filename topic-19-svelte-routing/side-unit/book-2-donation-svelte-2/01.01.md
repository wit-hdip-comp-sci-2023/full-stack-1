# Store

In the lib folder, create a new file:

### src/lib/runes.svelte.ts

~~~typescript
export const subTitle = $state("");
export const loggedInUser = $state("");
~~~

These are runes - values that can be changed from anywhere in an application and, if used correctly, updated dynamically on any UX they are embedded in.

- `subTitle`, the current sub title to be used on a window

- `loggedInUser` will contain the email of the currently logged in user email

We will use the stores in the next steps
