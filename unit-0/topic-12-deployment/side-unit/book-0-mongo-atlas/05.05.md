# Test Application Connection

Back in our Playtime application, we already have a .env file:

```bash
cookie_name=COOKIE_NAME_HERE_MUST_BE_32_CHARS__
cookie_password=COOKIE_EMCRYPTION_KEY_HERE_BE_32_CHARS
db=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/playtime?directConnection=true
```

Comment out the db entry, and insert a new connections string from the clipboard:

~~~
mongodb+srv://playtime:<db_password>@cl0ster0.gtgl.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
~~~

Replace the `<db_password>` with your password so your .env might look like this:

~~~bash
cookie_name=COOKIE_NAME_HERE_MUST_BE_32_CHARS__
cookie_password=COOKIE_EMCRYPTION_KEY_HERE_BE_32_CHARS
# db=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/playtime?directConnection=true
db=mongodb+srv://playt1me:playtime@cl0ster0.gmtgl.m0ng0db.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
~~~

Restart the application, and verify that it connects successfully:

```bash
Server running at: http://localhost:3000
database connected to test on cluster0-shard-00-00.rhm4m.mongodb.net
```

Verify that you can operate the application. 

Also, on the mongo service, you should be able to browse the collections:

Check Studio3T that the database is updating as expected.

## .env & github

If your application is on a public github repo, you will want to avoid committing the above changes to .env (with the new database access string), as this will enable access to whoever can copy the string.
