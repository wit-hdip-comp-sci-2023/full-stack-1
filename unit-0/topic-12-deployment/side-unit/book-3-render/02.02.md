## Node Version:

We already have from the last step the node version:

### package.json

~~~json
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=16"
  }
~~~

We can leave that as us - although you may have noticed some warnings in glitch that some of our libraries require Node 18. This didn't cause our app to fail however. 

We can leave it at 16 for compatibility with Glitch. Render will install a later version however.
