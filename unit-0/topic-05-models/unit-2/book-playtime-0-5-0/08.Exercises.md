# Exercises

This is the Playtime application at the end of this lab:

- [playtime-0.5.0](https://github.com/wit-hdip-comp-sci-2023/full-stack-1/tree/main/prj/playtime/playtime-0.5.0)

## Exercise 1

The current track-mongo-model is partially complete:

~~~javascript
import { Track } from "./track.js";

export const trackMongoStore = {
  async getTracksByPlaylistId(id) {
    const tracks = await Track.find({ playlistid: id }).lean();
    return tracks;
  },
};
~~~

Complete this now, but do so in conjunction with a set of Track model tests. You can base these tests on the existing playlist tests.

## Exercise 2

You should now be able to run the UX for the application configured to use the Mongo database. Do this now and verify that the features behave as expected. Use Robo3T to verify that the users/playlists/tracks are being created as expected.
