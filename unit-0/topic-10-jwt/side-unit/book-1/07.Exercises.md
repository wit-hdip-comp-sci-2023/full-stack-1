# Exercises

- This is the Playtime application at the end of this lab:

  - [playtime-0.9.0](https://github.com/wit-hdip-comp-sci-2024/full-stack-1/tree/main/prj/playtime/playtime-0.9.0)

  

### Exercise 1: Input Authenticate Schemas

The authenticate route is not currently available to the Swagger/OpenAPI documentation system.  Try to document the input parameters. This seems fairly straightforward, as we already have **UserCredentialSpec**. This should generate the appropriate documentation - but it will break the tests. See if you can figure out why the tests are breaking (and fix them).

### Exercise 2: Output Authenticate Schemas

This is the structure of successful authentication response:

~~~javascript
          return h.response({ success: true, token: token }).code(201);
~~~

Create an appropriate schema such that this will be documented as a Swagger/OpenAPI response.
