# JWT

With a robust API in place, including accurate API documentation + a set of tests, we can turn our attention to securing the API. Hapi has solid support for using JWT based security when developing APIs. It uses the security strategy mechanism already built into Hapi. It also has a number of plugins provided much of the implementation.

With a robust API in place, including accurate API documentation + a set of tests, we can turn our attention to securing the API. Hapi provides solid support for implementing JWT-based security when developing APIs. It leverages the security strategy mechanism already built into Hapi and offers a number of plugins that facilitate much of the implementation process.

We start with these two:

- https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2
- https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken

First install these packages:

~~~bash
npm install hapi-auth-jwt2 jsonwebtoken
~~~

We need a set of utilities for encoding, decoding and validating tokens. Create this in the api folder for the moment:

### jwt-utils.js

~~~javascript
import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import { db } from "../models/db.js";

const result = dotenv.config();

export function createToken(user) {
  const payload = {
    id: user._id,
    email: user.email,
  };
  const options = {
    algorithm: "HS256",
    expiresIn: "1h",
  };
  return jwt.sign(payload, process.env.cookie_password, options);
}

export function decodeToken(token) {
  const userInfo = {};
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.cookie_password);
    userInfo.userId = decoded.id;
    userInfo.email = decoded.email;
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e.message);
  }
  return userInfo;
}

export async function validate(decoded, request) {
  const user = await db.userStore.getUserById(decoded.id);
  if (!user) {
    return { isValid: false };
  }
  return { isValid: true, credentials: user };
}
~~~

To initialise the JWT system, import and register the plugin:

### server.js

~~~javascript
import jwt from "hapi-auth-jwt2";
import { validate } from "./api/jwt-utils.js";
...
  await server.register(jwt);
...

~~~

We can then define a new strategy, accompanying the cookie based strategy we have already defined:

~~~javascript
  server.auth.strategy("jwt", "jwt", {
    key: process.env.cookie_password,
    validate: validate,
    verifyOptions: { algorithms: ["HS256"] }
  });
~~~

With this infrastructure in place, we can start to secure our routes.
