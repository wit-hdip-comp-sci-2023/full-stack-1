# Engage the JSON Stores

Even though we have included the JSON Store modules, the application is still wired to use the Mem Stores. This is easily changed:

## db.js

~~~javascript
// import { userMemStore } from "./mem/user-mem-store.js";
// import { playlistMemStore } from "./mem/playlist-mem-store.js";
// import { trackMemStore } from "./mem/track-mem-store.js";

import { userJsonStore } from "./json/user-json-store.js";
import { playlistJsonStore } from "./json/playlist-json-store.js";
import { trackJsonStore } from "./json/track-json-store.js";

export const db = {
  userStore: null,
  playlistStore: null,
  trackStore: null,

  init() {
    this.userStore = userJsonStore;
    this.playlistStore = playlistJsonStore;
    this.trackStore = trackJsonStore;
  },
};
~~~

This is the only change we need to make, as all of the controllers access the data store via the `db` object, which we have remapped to there JSON Stores above 

As you add users, playlists and tracks keep an eye on the file `db.json`. This will be created when you first signup / log in - and then updated as you add users, playlists and tracks.

*The approach we are taking above - introducing a new store implementation without major modification to the application - will be discussed in more detail in the next topic.*
