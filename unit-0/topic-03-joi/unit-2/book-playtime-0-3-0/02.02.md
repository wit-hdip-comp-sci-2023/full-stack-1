# Exercise 3

Currently the cookie name + password are embedded in server.js:

~~~javascript
    cookie: {
      name: "playtime",
      password: "secretpasswordnotrevealedtoanyone",
      isSecure: false,
    },
~~~

In general we should attempt to "externalise" sensitive information, secrets or API details to a text file. This is usually called `.env`

### .env

~~~bash
cookie_name=playtime
cookie_password=secretpasswordnotrevealedtoanyone
~~~

This module here can help load this information:

- <https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#readme>

See if you can integrate this into your app, replacing the hard coded strings in server.js

## Exercise 3 Solution

First install the package:

~~~bash
npm install dotenv
~~~

Import the package in server, and check for the presence of the .env file, exiting if not found:

### server.js

~~~javascript
import dotenv from "dotenv";

const result = dotenv.config();
if (result.error) {
  console.log(result.error.message);
  process.exit(1);
}
~~~

If we have included the `.env` file above at the root of our project, then we can directly access its entries. So, our cookie configuration can now import these values:

~~~javascript
    cookie: {
      name: process.env.COOKIE_NAME,
      password: process.env.COOKIE_PASSWORD,
      isSecure: false,
    },
~~~

We may choose to exclude the .env file, by introducing an entry into .gitignore

### .gitignore

~~~bash
.env
~~~

A common practice is you introduce a new file called `.env_example` which contains dummy values

### .env_example

~~~bash
COOKIE_NAME=cookie_name_here
COOKIE_PASSWORD=cookie_encryption_key_here
~~~

The above practice enables someone downloading the repo to get up and running quickly - as the 'secret' .env file may not be in the repo, but the example one will be.

Verify that the all works as expected.



## Exercise 4

What happens when a user logs out? The cookie should be deleted. Implement cookie deletion in the logout action.

### Solution

Modify the logout handler to clear the cookie:

~~~javascript
  logout: {
    handler: function (request, h) {
      request.cookieAuth.clear();
      return h.redirect("/");
    },
  },
~~~
