# Exercises

## Exercise 3

Currently the cookie name + password are embedded in server.js:

~~~javascript
    cookie: {
      name: "playtime",
      password: "secretpasswordnotrevealedtoanyone",
      isSecure: false,
    },
~~~

In general we should attempt to "externalise" sensitive information, secrets or API details to a text file. This is usually called `.env`

## .env

~~~bash
cookie_name=playlist
cookie_password=secretpasswordnotrevealedtoanyone
~~~

This module here can help load this information:

See if you can integrate this into your app, replacing the hard coded strings in server.js

## Exercise 4

What happens when a user logs out? The cookie should be deleted. Implement cookie deletion in the logout action.
