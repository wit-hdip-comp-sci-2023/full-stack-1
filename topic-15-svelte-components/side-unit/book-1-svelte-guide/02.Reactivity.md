# Reactivity

## State

At the heart of Svelte is a powerful system of _reactivity_ for keeping the DOM in sync with your application state — for example, in response to an event.

Make the `count` declaration reactive by wrapping the value with `$state(...)`:

~~~js
let count = $state(0);
~~~

This is called a _rune_, and it's how you tell Svelte that `count` isn't an ordinary variable. Runes look like functions, but they're not — when you use Svelte, they're part of the language itself.

All that's left is to implement `increment`:

~~~js
function increment() {
  count += 1;
}
~~~

#### App.svelte

~~~svelte
<script>
  let count = $state(0);

  function increment() {
    count += 1;
  }
</script>

<button onclick={increment}>
  Clicked {count}
  {count === 1 ? 'time' : 'times'}
</button>
~~~

## Deep state

As we saw in the previous exercise, state reacts to _reassignments_. But it also reacts to _mutations_ — we call this _deep reactivity_.

Make `numbers` a reactive array:

~~~js
let numbers = $state([1, 2, 3, 4]);
~~~

Now, when we change the array...

~~~js
function addNumber() {
  numbers[numbers.length] = numbers.length + 1;
}
~~~

...the component updates. Or better still, we can `push` to the array instead:

~~~js
function addNumber() {
  numbers.push(numbers.length + 1);
}
~~~

> [!NOTE] Deep reactivity is implemented using [proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy), and mutations to the proxy do not affect the original object.


#### App.svelte
~~~svelte
<script>
  let numbers = $state([1, 2, 3, 4]);

  function addNumber() {
    numbers.push(numbers.length + 1);
  }
</script>

<p>{numbers.join(' + ')} = ...</p>

<button onclick={addNumber}>
  Add a number
</button>
~~~

## Derived state

Often, you will need to _derive_ state from other state. For this, we have the `$derived` rune:

~~~js
let numbers = $state([1, 2, 3, 4]);
let total = $derived(numbers.reduce((t, n) => t + n, 0));
~~~

We can now use this in our markup:

~~~svelte
<p>{numbers.join(' + ')} = {total}</p>
~~~

The expression inside the `$derived` declaration will be re-evaluated whenever its dependencies (in this case, just `numbers`) are updated. Unlike normal state, derived state is read-only.

### App.svelte

~~~svelte
<script>
  let numbers = $state([1, 2, 3, 4]);
  let total = $derived(numbers.reduce((t, n) => t + n, 0));

  function addNumber() {
    numbers.push(numbers.length + 1);
  }
</script>

<p>{numbers.join(' + ')} = {total}</p>

<button onclick={addNumber}>
  Add a number
</button>
~~~

## Inspecting state

It's often useful to be able to track the value of a piece of state as it changes over time.

Inside the `addNumber` function, we've added a `console.log` statement. But if you click the button and open the console drawer (using the button to the right of the URL bar), you'll see a warning, and a message saying the message could not be cloned.

That's because `numbers` is a reactive [proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy). There are a couple of things we can do. Firstly, we can create a non-reactive _snapshot_ of the state with `$state.snapshot(...)`:

~~~js
function addNumber() {
  numbers.push(numbers.length + 1);
  console.log($state.snapshot(numbers));
}
~~~

Alternatively, we can use the `$inspect` rune to automatically log a snapshot of the state whenever it changes. This code will automatically be stripped out of your production build:

~~~js
function addNumber() {
  numbers.push(numbers.length + 1);
  ---console.log($state.snapshot(numbers));---
}

$inspect(numbers);
~~~

You can customise how the information is displayed by using `$inspect(...).with(fn)` — for example, you can use `console.trace` to see where the state change originated from:

~~~js
$inspect(numbers).with(console.trace);
~~~

#### App.svelte
~~~svelte
<script>
  let numbers = $state([1, 2, 3, 4]);
  let total = $derived(numbers.reduce((t, n) => t + n, 0));

  function addNumber() {
    numbers.push(numbers.length + 1);
  }

  $inspect(numbers).with(console.trace);
</script>

<p>{numbers.join(' + ')} = {total}</p>

<button onclick={addNumber}>
  Add a number
</button>
~~~

## Effects

So far we've talked about reactivity in terms of state. But that's only half of the equation — state is only reactive if something is _reacting_ to it, otherwise it's just a sparkling variable.

The thing that reacts is called an _effect_. You've already encountered effects — the ones that Svelte creates on your behalf to update the DOM in response to state changes — but you can also create your own with the `$effect` rune.

> [!NOTE] Most of the time, you shouldn't. `$effect` is best thought of as an escape hatch, rather than something to use frequently. If you can put your side effects in an [event handler](dom-events), for example, that's almost always preferable.

Let's say we want to use `setInterval` to keep track of how long the component has been mounted. Create the effect:

~~~svelte
<script>
  let elapsed = $state(0);
  let interval = $state(1000);

 $effect(() => {
    setInterval(() => {
      elapsed += 1;
    }, interval);
  });
</script>
~~~

Click the 'speed up' button a few times and notice that `elapsed` ticks up faster, because we're calling `setInterval` each time `interval` gets smaller.

If we then click the 'slow down' button... well, it doesn't work. That's because we're not clearing out the old intervals when the effect updates. We can fix that by returning a cleanup function:

~~~js
$effect(() => {
  const id = setInterval(() => {
    elapsed += 1;
  }, interval);

 return () => {
    clearInterval(id);
  };
});
~~~

The cleanup function is called immediately before the effect function re-runs when `interval` changes, and also when the component is destroyed.

If the effect function doesn't read any state when it runs, it will only run once, when the component mounts.

> [!NOTE] Effects do not run during server-side rendering.

### App.svelte

~~~svelte
<script>
  let elapsed = $state(0);
  let interval = $state(1000);

  $effect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      elapsed += 1;
    }, interval);

    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
    };
  });
</script>

<button onclick={() => interval /= 2}>speed up</button>
<button onclick={() => interval *= 2}>slow down</button>

<p>elapsed: {elapsed}</p>
~~~

## Universal reactivity

In the preceding exercises, we used runes to add reactivity inside components. But we can also use runes _outside_ components, for example to share some global state.

The `<Counter>` components in this exercise are all importing the `counter` object from `shared.js`. But it's a normal object, and as such nothing happens when you click the buttons. Wrap the object in `$state(...)`:

~~~js
export const counter = $state({
  count: 0
});
~~~

This causes an error, because you can't use runes in normal `.js` files, only `.svelte.js` files. Let's fix that — rename the file to `shared.svelte.js`.

Then, update the import declaration in `Counter.svelte`:

~~~svelte
<script>
  import { counter } from './shared.svelte.js';
</script>
~~~

Now, when you click any button, all three update simultaneously.

> [!NOTE] You cannot export a `$state` declaration from a module if the declaration is reassigned (rather than just mutated), because the importers would have no way to know about it.


#### shared.svelte.ts

~~~javascript
export const counter = $state({
  count: 0
});
~~~

#### Counter.svelte

~~~svelte
<script>
  import { counter } from './shared.svelte.js';
</script>

<button onclick={() => counter.count += 1}>
  clicks: {counter.count}
</button>
~~~

#### App.svelte

~~~svelte
<script>
  import Counter from './Counter.svelte';
</script>

<Counter />
<Counter />
<Counter />
~~~
