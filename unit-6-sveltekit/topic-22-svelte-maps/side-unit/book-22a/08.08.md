# Live Map Update

You will notice that as you add new donations, they are not appearing on the map.

First of all define a function which we would like to have invoked whenever a donation is made:

### src/routes/donate/+page.svelte

~~~typescript
  function donationMade(donation:Donation) {
    map.addMarker(donation.lat, donation.lng, "");
    map.moveTo(donation.lat, donation.lng);
  }
~~~

This accepts a donation, and puts a marker wherever it is located, and flys to this location.

Now we update DonateForm to accept such a function as a parameter:

### src/routes/donate/DonateForm.svelte

~~~typescript
//...
  let { donationEvent } = $props();
//...
~~~

Iniside the donate method, we can invoke this method if a donation is successful:

~~~typescript
    //...
      if (donationEvent) donationEvent(donation);
      message = `Thanks! You donated ${amount} to ${candidate.firstName} ${candidate.lastName}`;
    //...
~~~

Finally, we need to pass this method to the DonateForm component:

### src/routes/donate/+page.svelte

~~~typescript
  //...
    <Card title="Please Donate">
      <DonateForm donationEvent={donationMade}/>
    </Card>
  //...
~~~

Try this now - as you make donations you should see the map update dynamically
