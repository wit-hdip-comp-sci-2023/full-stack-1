# SvelteKit

We will deploy this application:

- [Donation Svelte 07 Maps](https://github.com/wit-hdip-comp-sci-2024/donation-svelte-07-maps)

First, we will need to make once change the the source. Currently the donationService object is hard coded to use a local version of the hapi application:

### src/lib/services/donation-service.ts

~~~javascript
...
export const donationService = {
	baseUrl: "http://localhost:4000",
...  
~~~

Change this to the url of your deplpyed application:

~~~typescript
export const donationService = {
  // baseUrl: "http://localhost:4000",
  baseUrl: "https://YOUR_HAPI_APPLICATION+URL",
~~~

Make sure there is no trailing `/` in the url.

## Netlify

Netlify have full documentation on SvelteKit deployment:

- <https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/sveltekit/>

A successful deployment can usually be accomplished with these three steps:

#### 1: Install adapter

On the command line, enter:

~~~bash
npm install -D @sveltejs/adapter-netlify
~~~

#### 2: Configure adapter

Your project already has a svelte.config.js file:

##### svelte.config.js

~~~javascript
import adapter from "@sveltejs/adapter-auto";
import { vitePreprocess } from "@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte";

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
  // Consult https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/integrations
  // for more information about preprocessors
  preprocess: vitePreprocess(),

  kit: {
    // adapter-auto only supports some environments, see https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-auto for a list.
    // If your environment is not supported, or you settled on a specific environment, switch out the adapter.
    // See https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters for more information about adapters.
    adapter: adapter()
  }
};

export default config;
~~~

Modify the above as follows:

~~~javascript
// import adapter from "@sveltejs/adapter-auto";
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-netlify';
import { vitePreprocess } from "@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte";

//...
~~~

(Just the first line has been adjusted)

#### 3: Include TOML file

If we include this file in our project, the Netlify will know how to build the app:

##### netlify.toml

~~~toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "build"
~~~

Comit and push the above to the github repo
