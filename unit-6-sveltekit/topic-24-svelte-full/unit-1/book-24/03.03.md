# DB Connection

We will be connecting directly the Mongo database. Introduce this connection component:

### src/lib/models/db.ts

~~~typescript
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import { MONGO_URL } from "$env/static/private";
/* 
  0 - disconnected
  1 - connected
  2 - connecting
  3 - disconnecting
  4 - uninitialized
*/
const mongoConnection = {
  isConnected: 0
};

export const dbConnect = async () => {
  console.log("MONGO_URL", MONGO_URL);
  if (mongoConnection.isConnected === 1) {
    console.log("already connected");
    return;
  }

  if (mongoose.connections.length > 0) {
    mongoConnection.isConnected = mongoose.connections[0].readyState;
    if (mongoConnection.isConnected === 1) {
      console.log("using existing connection");
      return;
    }

    await mongoose.disconnect();
  }
  await mongoose.connect(MONGO_URL);
  mongoConnection.isConnected = 1;
  console.log("conected to ", MONGO_URL ?? "");
};

export const dbDisconnect = async () => {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") return;
  if (mongoConnection.isConnected === 0) return;

  await mongoose.disconnect();
  mongoConnection.isConnected = 0;
  console.log("disconnecting");
};
~~~

For this to compile successfully, we need the connection string. This is defined in a .env file, just like for the donation-hapi app:

### .env

~~~bash
MONGO_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/donation?directConnection=true
~~~

You might need to restart the application as you introduce this last file.

This connection is to be from the *server side*, not the client. The preferred mechanism in SvelteKit for this is via the introduction of this module:

### src/hooks.server.ts

~~~typescript
import { dbConnect } from "$lib/models/db";
import type { Handle } from "@sveltejs/kit";

await dbConnect();

export const handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
  const response = await resolve(event);
  return response;
};
~~~

This is a hook function - that will run on the server when the application launches.

If you restart the app you should see a successful connection message (on the server log), if you have the database running locally.
