# Logout

Currently the log out method does not function correctly. We must do two things here:

- Delete the cookie
- Delete the Session store

This will ensure the cookie will be related on this route:

### routes/logout/+page.server.ts

~~~typescript
export const load = async ({ cookies }) => {
  cookies.delete("donation-user", { path: "/" });
};
~~~

To delete the loggedInUser rune create a new helper function:

### lib/services/donation-utils.ts

~~~typescript
export function clearDonationState() {
  currentDonations.donations = [];
  currentCandidates.candidates = [];
  loggedInUser.email = "";
  loggedInUser.name = "";
  loggedInUser.token = "";
  loggedInUser._id = "";
}
~~~

Call this in the logout page then:

### routes/logout/+page.svelte

~~~html
<script lang="ts">
  import { browser } from "$app/environment";
  import { goto } from "$app/navigation";
  import { clearDonationState } from "$lib/services/donation-utils";

  clearDonationState();
  if (browser) goto("/");
</script>
~~~

Try this now - logout should function correctly.

However, there is one more piece to the puzzle. You may notice that if you hover over the logout menu item, you will be logged out of the application! This is because of a feature of SvelteKit called 'pre-loading':

- <https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/link-options>

This is inappropriate in this context - so we disable via a link options:

### src/lib/ui/Menu.svelte

~~~html
<a data-sveltekit-preload-data="tap" class="navbar-item" href="/logout"> Logout [{$currentSession?.name}]</a>
~~~

Try this now - logout should function as expected - and not be triggered by just hovering on the menu item.
