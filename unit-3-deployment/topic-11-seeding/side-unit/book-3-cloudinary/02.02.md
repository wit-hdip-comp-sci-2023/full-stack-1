# Upload Image UX

We would like to associate an image with each playlist. This image will be stored in the Cloudinary service, but we will retain a link to the image in each playlist object in our data store.

In the next few steps, we will make the following changes. Starting with the playlist view, we will introduce a new panel to permit an images to be uploaded:

The image should be visible in our Cloudinary dashboard:

We will then extend the datastore to store the image link as an **img** string:
