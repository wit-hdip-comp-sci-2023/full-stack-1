# ImageStore

Before implementing the uploadImage controller method, we will introduce a new utility class for interacting with the Cloudinary service. This will provide these features:

- Initialise Cloudinary account credentials
- Retrieve all images from your account
- Upload an image
- Delete an image

Our object will encapsulate the Cloudinary node library, which you can install now:

~~~bash
npm install cloudinary
~~~

This is the implementation of the imageStore:

### models/image-store.js

~~~javascript
import * as cloudinary from "cloudinary";
import { writeFileSync } from "fs";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

const credentials = {
  cloud_name: process.env.cloudinary_name,
  api_key: process.env.cloudinary_key,
  api_secret: process.env.cloudinary_secret
};
cloudinary.config(credentials);

export const imageStore = {

  getAllImages: async function() {
    const result = await cloudinary.v2.api.resources();
    return result.resources;
  },

  uploadImage: async function(imagefile) {
    writeFileSync("./public/temp.img", imagefile);
    const response = await cloudinary.v2.uploader.upload("./public/temp.img");
    return response.url;
  },

  deleteImage: async function(img) {
    await cloudinary.v2.uploader.destroy(img, {});
  }
};
~~~

Our strategy in the upload method is to:

- Save the in memory buffer to a temporary file
- Upload this file using the appropriate cloudinary method

There are other strategies, but this will do fine for the moment.
