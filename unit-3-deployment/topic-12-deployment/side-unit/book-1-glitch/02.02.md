# Node Version

We will need to be explicit about the version of Node we are using, as the default version on Glitch may be inappropriate for our application. Introduce this entry into package.json:

### package.json

~~~json
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=16"
  }
~~~

Make sure you do not introduce any syntax errors when you bring this into the file.

## Environment Variables

Before deploying the application - we need to revisit our .env file. We will need to have the mongo connection string to refer to a version of the database available in the cloud (in Mongo Cloud Atlas for instance):

```bash
cookie_name=COOKIE_NAME_HERE_MUST_BE_32_CHARS__
cookie_password=COOKIE_EMCRYPTION_KEY_HERE_BE_32_CHARS
# db=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/playtime?directConnection=true
db=mongodb+srv://playt1me:playtime@cl0ster0.gmtgl.m0ng0db.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
```

You will need your own versions of these values

Recall, these are loaded when our application starts, and are essential configuration parameters. We are loading these parameters in server.js like this:

```javascript
const result = dotenv.config();
if (result.error) {
  console.log(result.error.message);
  process.exit(1);
}
```

Make sure you application functions correctly locally first, with the cloud atlas + cloudinary keys for your own accounts.
