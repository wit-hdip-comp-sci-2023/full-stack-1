- <https://madewithsvelte.com/>
- <https://sveltesociety.dev/components>
- <https://github.com/rocketlaunchr/awesome-svelte>
- <https://github.com/TheComputerM/awesome-svelte>

In this lab we will integrate this component:

- <https://github.com/himynameisdave/svelte-frappe-charts>

This is an encapsulation of this component:
