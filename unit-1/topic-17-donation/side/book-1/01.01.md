# Create

To start a project, create a folder - call it `donation-hapi`, open a shell inside the new folder and enter:

~~~bash
npm init
~~~

This will launch a command line app, which will ask you a series of questions about the node app it will create. Accept all of the defaults:

~~~bash
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

About to write to /Users/edeleastar/repos/modules/hdip/2023/prj/full-stack/donation-hapi-2024/donation-hapi-01/package.json:

{
  "name": "donation-hapi",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"

This command creates a single fine - package.json:

## package.json

~~~json
{
  "name": "donation-hapi-01",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
~~~

Modify as follows:

~~~json
{
  "name": "donation-hapi-01",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "src/server.js",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
~~~

We have changed:

- The "version" 
- The "server" script to src/server.js
- A new "type" is set to "module"
