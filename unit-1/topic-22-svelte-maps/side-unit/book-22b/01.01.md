# Svelte

We have been using SvelteKit for the donation-svelte application series. However the Todo app from labs 12 and 13 was a simple svelte app.

The deploy the todo app, first package the app via this command:

~~~
npm run build
~~~

This will rebuild the application:

~~~bash
> todo-svelte@0.2.0 build
> vite build

vite v4.0.4 building for production...
✓ 24 modules transformed.

This will generate a bundled version of the application into the **dist** folder in your project.

The app should function as expected.

If you press the Domain Settings button you will be able to edit/change the default name (but not the domain).
