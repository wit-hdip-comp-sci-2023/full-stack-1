# User Playlists

If you experiment with the app now - it should work as before. However, all users share the same global playlist.

In order to support user specific playlists we need to make some further changes:

## playlist-mem-store.js

~~~javascript
  async getUserPlaylists(userid) {
    return playlists.filter((playlist) => playlist.userid === userid);
  },
~~~

This method returns playlists by userid - assuming each playlist has this userid field.

In dashboard, we can now make sure playlists are stored and retrieved by userid:

## dashboard-controller.js

~~~javascript
import { db } from "../models/db.js";

export const dashboardController = {
  index: {
    handler: async function (request, h) {
      const loggedInUser = request.auth.credentials;
      const playlists = await db.playlistStore.getUserPlaylists(loggedInUser._id);
      const viewData = {
        title: "Playtime Dashboard",
        user: loggedInUser,
        playlists: playlists,
      };
      return h.view("dashboard-view", viewData);
    },
  },

  addPlaylist: {
    handler: async function (request, h) {
      const loggedInUser = request.auth.credentials;
      const newPlayList = {
        userid: loggedInUser._id,
        title: request.payload.title,
      };
      await db.playlistStore.addPlaylist(newPlayList);
      return h.redirect("/dashboard");
    },
  },
};
~~~

In the above, when adding a playlist we include the users ID, we recover the user from the session, and use the user ID as the `userid` property of the new playlist:

~~~javascript
      const loggedInUser = request.auth.credentials;
      const newPlayList = {
        userid: loggedInUser._id,
        title: request.payload.title,
      };
      await db.playlistStore.addPlaylist(newPlayList);
~~~

Similarly, when displaying the dashboard, we only retrieve playlists for the authenticated user:

~~~javascript
      const loggedInUser = request.auth.credentials;
      const playlists = await db.playlistStore.getUserPlaylists(loggedInUser._id);
~~~

Try this now - make sure you can log in multiple users, with each playlist specific to each user.
