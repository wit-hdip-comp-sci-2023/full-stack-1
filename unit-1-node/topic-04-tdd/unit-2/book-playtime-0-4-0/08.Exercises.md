# Exercises

This is the Playtime application at the end if this lab:

- [playtime-0.4.0.zip](archives/playtime-0.4.0.zip)

## Exercise 1

Currently, we are only testing the JSON users module, as defined in db.js:

### db.js

~~~javascript
import { userJsonStore } from "./json/user-json-store.js";
import { playlistJsonStore } from "./json/playlist-json-store.js";
import { trackJsonStore } from "./json/track-json-store.js";

export const db = {
  userStore: null,
  playlistStore: null,
  trackStore: null,

  init() {
    this.userStore = userJsonStore;
    this.playlistStore = playlistJsonStore;
    this.trackStore = trackJsonStore;
  },
};
~~~

Make the changes to enable the tests to exercise the Memory store users module. Fix any issues in user-mem-store that might arise.

## Exercise 2

Using the users tests as an example, devise a set of tests for the playlist datastore. These should exercise the essential features + edge cases as demonstrated in the tests devised this lab. Note: some of the bugs we uncovered in the user store may resurface in the playlist store.
