# Modules & Scripts

We are building a hapi app, using the modules & libraries we have been studying so far. We could proceed through a series of **npm install** commands (like the last step). Easier, however, to directly introduce new dependencies by editing the package.json.

First bring in this new section into the package file:

#### package.json

~~~javascript
  "dependencies": {
    "@hapi/boom": "^10.0.1",
    "@hapi/cookie": "^12.0.1",
    "@hapi/hapi": "^21.3.8",
    "@hapi/inert": "^7.1.0",
    "@hapi/vision": "^7.0.3",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.5",
    "handlebars": "^4.7.8",
    "mais-mongoose-seeder": "^1.0.7",
    "mongoose": "^8.3.0"
  }
~~~

Make sure the package.json is still valid after the insertion.

Be sure to run **npm install** to install these libraries:

~~~bash
added 60 packages, and audited 275 packages in 7s

86 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details
  
found 0 vulnerabilities
~~~

As a final check on the versions, install this version checker globally:

~~~bash
npm install npm-check-updates -g
~~~

Looking at the documentation:

- <https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates>

To check if we have the latest versions, try this command:

~~~bash
ncu
~~~

If this reports some updates you are not using, you will need to run the command again:

~~~bash
ncu -u
~~~

This will modify the package.json entry - buy you will need to run **npm install** again to update.

Note: if the version numbers are minor and patch, then it is quite likely you already have the latest version - due to the **^** symbol in your package.json. If the major number has been updated, then you will be getting a new (potentially api breaking) version.

### Scripts

Also in package.json, modify the scripts section to contain the following:

~~~javascript
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/server.js ",
    "dev": "./node_modules/.bin/nodemon src/server.js  --ignore 'src/models/json/*.json'",
    "lint": "./node_modules/.bin/eslint . --ext .js"
  },
~~~

Note: if you are on windows, you could set this version of these scripts:

~~~javascript
    "dev": "npx nodemon src/server.js  --ignore 'src/models/json/*.json'",
    "lint": "npx eslint . --ext .js",
    "test": "npx mocha --ui tdd test/**/*.js"
~~~
