# Introduce TypeScript

We can first install TypeScript into the project:

~~~bash
npm install -D typescript
~~~

Then bring in this TypeScript configuration to the root of the project:

This new configuration file will define TypeScript setting for the project:

### tsconfig.json

~~~json
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig",
  "display": "Node 20",

  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["es2022"],
    "module": "es2022",
    "target": "es2022",

    "strict": false,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "rootDir": "./src"
  }
}
~~~

In order to trigger the TypeScript correctly, we need 2 new script entries:

### package.json

~~~json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "dev:tsc": "tsc --watch",
    ...
  }
~~~

The second command above, which you execute from the terminal like this:

~~~bash
npm run dev:tsc
~~~

Runs a background task - which you should leave running in its own terminal. This will watch for any TypeScript files and compile them to javascript whenever they are modified. You should keep an eye on this terminal - as sometimes if there are too many errors which may require you to restart the script with the same command.

As we have no TypeScript in the project yet, you may get the following error:

~~~bash
[5:45:29 PM] Starting compilation in watch mode...

error TS18003: No inputs were found in config file '/Users/edeleastar/repos/modules/hdip/2023/prj/full-stack/donation-hapi-2024/donation-hapi-02-web-test/tsconfig.json'. Specified 'include' paths were '["**/*"]' and 'exclude' paths were '[]'.

[5:45:29 PM] Found 1 error. Watching for file changes.
~~~

### @types

Most of the libraries we are using have TypeScript types defined for them, usually by the authors of those libraries. These type definitions will enable us to convert our project to TypeScript, even as most of the libraries we are using remain in Javascript. 

The type definitions ensure that the TypeScript compiler will check we are using the libraries correctly.

Introduce these new entries into package.json:

### package.json

~~~json
  "devDependencies": {
    "ts-node": "^10.9.2",
    "@types/hapi__cookie": "^12.0.5",
    "@types/hapi__inert": "^5.2.10",
    "@types/hapi__vision": "^5.5.8",
    "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin": "^7.5.0",
    "@typescript-eslint/parser": "^7.5.0",
    //...
    // as before
~~~

Run the usual install command:

~~~bash
npm install
~~~

In the next step we will try out our first TS file, and this error will no longer be shown
