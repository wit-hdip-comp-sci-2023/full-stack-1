          "description": "<p><strong>Lough Foyle</strong> C660-390          Sheet 3/4 Embarkation The logical embarkation point for the outer regions of Lough Foyle is Magilligan Point, by the Martello Tower. Access is by the B202 past the prison and rifle range. Do not block roads. Park by the hotel. The whole region is a security area, frequently patrolled. Especially beware of the military zone on the beach immediately to the E of the point, Benone Beach, on which itâ€™s better not to land (certainly not while firing is going on). Accurate information for those passing the firing range can now be obtained from CANI. Further to the E, beyond the military zone, there is public access at about C716-363. There is a concrete slip across the beach. However, the beach surfs and there is a strong tidal drift. This may have relevance for launching. Expect caravans, lifeguards, and beach casting anglers. Military installations on both sides show the importance of the lough in such terms. The whole lough is less interesting inwards to the SW. There are large areas of mudflats on the E side. That said, it is a busy, well marked and well lit area. It is excellent for night navigation, sheltered but with strong tides. If paddling up into the city, it is possible to take out at Prehen Boat Club upstream of the Craigavon Bridge on the E bank. Road access is better on the Donegal side and there are nice secluded beaches. Greencastle at C648-400 lies directly across from Magilligan Point. The Donegal shore gets the more interesting up towards Inishowen Head at C685-438. The sea is much more exposed beyond the head. Tides Fierce tides push through the narrows. Rates of 3.5kn should not be treated lightly. Eddies on the Donegal side run from Warren Point to Moville and are usable on both flood and ebb. Moville HW is 3:50 after Belfast.</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" width=\"308\"><strong>The Narrows</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"170\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"57\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">In</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">3:00 after Belfast HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">3.5kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">Out</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">3:00 before Belfast HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">3.5kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>The ebb begins an hour earlier at Magilligan Point.

The Downhill Hotel was closed and demolished.  An apartment block now fills the gap.  Parking and toilets are beside the apartments and access is by a stream through an archway under the railway. This spot is popular with anglers. The rocky area to the E of the prominent Mussenden Temple at C758-363 is loose basalt, eroded to provide caves and arches. Fulmar and Kittiwake thrive on the sewerage outfall. There is good access and parking at Castlerock village itself at C766-365, where there is parking and toilets at the beach access point. <strong>County Antrim</strong> Tidal overview On the north coast, the tide generally turns west at Belfast HW and east at Belfast LW. The tides are complex, particularly around Rathlin and should be studied carefully. Tides flow strongly at the headlands but there are usable eddies between.</p>\n",
