# Donate View

We might like to rework the donate view to show the donate form + the latest donations:

As we have DonationList component already, this is relatively easy to introduce. This is a revised version of the donate view to implement the above:

### src/routes/donate/+page.svelte

~~~html
<script lang="ts">
  import { currentSession, subTitle } from "$lib/stores";
  import DonateForm from "./DonateForm.svelte";
  import Card from "$lib/ui/Card.svelte";
  import { donationService } from "$lib/services/donation-service";
  import { onMount } from "svelte";
  import { get } from "svelte/store";
  import type { Candidate, Donation } from "$lib/types/donation-types";
  import DonationList from "$lib/ui/DonationList.svelte";

  let candidateList: Candidate[] = [];
  let donations: Donation[] = [];
  subTitle.set("Make a Donation");

  onMount(async () => {
    candidateList = await donationService.getCandidates(get(currentSession));
    donations = await donationService.getDonations(get(currentSession));
  });
</script>

<div class="columns">
  <div class="column">
    <Card title="Donations to Date">
      <DonationList {donations} />
    </Card>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <Card title="Please Donate">
      <DonateForm {candidateList} />
    </Card>
  </div>
</div>
~~~

In the above we have just placed another component on the form, and passed it the donations (which we retrieved on startup).

Try making a donation - although you should be able to successfully donate, the donation list will not be updated immediately (unless you switch the the report view and back again).

We will try one approach to fixing the in the next step.
