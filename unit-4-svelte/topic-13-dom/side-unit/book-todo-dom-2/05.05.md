# Implement Delete

As yet the element is not deleted form the on page list.

There are many strategies we could use here - including directly locating the element in the DOM and removing it.

However, we will take simpler approach - every time an item is to be deleted, we will remove it from the javascript array, and then render the todo list again (without the deleted entry).

First new methods to render and also delete all todos:

`renderAllTodos()` will use renderTodo to populate the table:

~~~javascript
function renderAllTodos() {
  for (let i = 0; i < todoItems.length; i++) {
    renderTodo(todoItems[i]);
  }
}
~~~

`deleteAllTodos()` can be implemented using this DOM API:

- [deleteRow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTableElement/deleteRow)

~~~
function deleteAllTodos() {
  let table = document.getElementById("todo-table");
  for (let i = 0; i < todoItems.length; i++) {
    table.deleteRow(-1);
  }
}
~~~

We can rewrite `deleteTodo()` now:

~~~javascript
function deleteTodo(id) {
  deleteAllTodos();
  const found = todoItems.findIndex((todo) => todo.id == id);
  todoItems.splice(found, 1);
  renderAllTodos();
}
~~~

Try the above now - you should be able to successfully delete a todo. In the above we are using these javascript array functions:

- [findIndex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex)
- [splice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice)
